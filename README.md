Most of theses frogs are based on the SVGs of the twitter emoji set (https://twemoji.twitter.com). Others are unique designs with other inspirations in mind.

Have fun using them! üê∏

## Contributing
When submitting PRs keep the following in mind please:

- only submit SVGs.
- use the following naming scheme: verb/adjective+Frog+Object+Differential with camelCase. For example, `sleepyFrogFamilyTkg` for an emoji with a sleepy frog family, which is differentiated from a sleepy frog family, by including Tkg.
  - should you submit an emoji that has a clear emoji mapping to it, please prefix it with `U[unicodeChracter]-`. For example, `U1f35e-frogBread`.
  - should you be on Windows and case sensitivity seems to commit wrong, run the following command in the git repo: `git config core.ignorecase false`
- only submit SVGs with the file ending `.svg`. Not `.SVG` or `.sVg`

## Generating PNGs 
If you want to generate PNGs from the SVGs, you can use the `gen_png.py` script.

### Dependencies
- Python 3.9 - To run the script.
- Inkscape - Used to generate the PNGs. Needs to be located in PATH.
- (Optional) git - Can be used to automatically add a new commit with the generated PNGs.

### Usage
```
gen_png.py [OPTION]

-h, --help                      Shows this help message.
-a, --all                       Generate PNGs of all SVGs.
-s, --specific S [S ...]        Generate PNGs for each S in the "svg" folder. The '.svg' suffix is optional.
-r, --resolution R [R ...]      Custom resolutions that will be generated instead of the defaults (72, 512, 1024).
-g, --git                       Generates PNGs of SVGs that changed since last auto tag and creates a git commit with them. Requires 'git' to be installed and located in PATH.
```
